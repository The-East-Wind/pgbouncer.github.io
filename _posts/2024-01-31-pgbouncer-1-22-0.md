PgBouncer 1.22.0 has been released. The main feature this release adds is
support for the `DISCARD ALL` and `DEALLOCATE ALL` commands when enabling
prepared statement support in transaction pooling mode (by setting
`max_prepared_statements` to a non-zero value). This is an important improvement
in the prepared statement support that clears the road for us to be able to
enable prepared statement support by default in a future release.

Other than that this release contains some small improvements and bugfixes,
including improvements to our recommended SystemD configuration files.

See the full details in the [changelog](/changelog.html#pgbouncer-122x).
