PgBouncer 1.20.0 has been released.  This release deprecates the online restart
feature using the `-R` flag, instead `so_reuseport` should be used for online
restarts. It also introduces better support for tracking PostgreSQL settings
using the new `track_extra_parameters` setting, which can be used to track
`search_path` in combination with Citus 12.0+. It also adds some other features
such as connecting using TLS by default, forwarding error codes in the
authentication phase and support for the `options` startup parameter. And
finally it also fixes a few minor bugs.

See the full details in the [changelog](/changelog.html#pgbouncer-120x).
